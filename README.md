1. In the Observer pattern, a `Subscriber` is typically an interface or trait to allow flexibility in defining multiple concrete subscribers. However, in our case, using a single `struct` is sufficient since the system has a predefined and fixed subscriber behavior. There is no need to dynamically vary the behavior of different subscribers, so we don't benefit much from using a trait.

2. The `id` in `Program` and the `url` in `Subscriber` must be unique to ensure no duplicate entries. Using a `Vec` would require us to manually check for duplicates on each operation, which is inefficient. `DashMap` allows constant time lookup, insert, and delete operations, making it more suitable for this use case where quick uniqueness validation is needed.

3. Rust enforces thread safety at the compiler level, but we still need runtime guarantees when sharing state across threads. `DashMap` provides thread-safe access to a HashMap, which is necessary for our use case since `SUBSCRIBERS` is a global mutable state accessed concurrently. Although the Singleton pattern ensures a single instance, it does not provide concurrency safety by itself. Thus, we still need `DashMap` to guarantee safe concurrent access.
